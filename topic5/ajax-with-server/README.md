# Ajax Request Demo with Local Server

In this demo, you run two separate servers:

1. A simple JSON API
2. A server to host your web page (client-side)

## Installation and use 

We assume you have installed `http-server` or some other simple server for the client-side page and JS.

1. Run `npm install` in  the `client` directory and the `server` directory
2. In one terminal window, navigate to the `server` directory and execute `node server.js`
3. In another terminal window, navigate to the `client` directory and execute `http-server`
